Hi There ðŸ‘‹

I am Akash Ghosh, a passionate and driven researcher currently working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate (PDRA) at the University of Manchesterâ€™s National Graphene Institute (NGI) and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur. My academic journey has been defined by a fascination with material science and innovation, spanning polymer chemistry, nanotechnology, and composite materials.

With an MTech in Polymer and Rubber Technology and MSc & BSc degrees in Applied and Industrial Chemistry, I have cultivated a strong foundation in the chemistry and engineering of polymers. Over the past four and a half years, I have developed a series of groundbreaking polymer materials tailored for diverse applications, including electronics, mechanics, and filtration technologies.

My research bridges the exciting domains of polymer science and 2D nanomaterials, with a focus on developing advanced composite materials. I am particularly passionate about the end-to-end design of mixed-domain polymers and nanomaterials, combining creativity and technical expertise to create solutions for advanced applications.

Currently, my work at NGI and IIT involves the development of graphene-based polymeric foams, exploring their potential for high-performance and multifunctional use cases. This builds on my prior experience formulating innovative materials like silicone, rubber, and polyurethane, leveraging Design of Experiments (DOE) and simulation tools such as Minitab to estimate, optimize, and predict material properties.

My toolkit extends beyond the laboratory bench, encompassing:

- Polymer and Nanomaterial Synthesis: Mastery in crafting diverse polymer matrices and embedding nanomaterials like graphene for enhanced functionalities.

- Applications Development: Expertise in tailoring materials for electronic, mechanical, and filtration systems.

- Data-Driven Innovation: Using DOE and computational simulations to model and refine material performance.

Hobbies & Personal Interests

When Iâ€™m not immersed in the world of materials science, youâ€™ll often find me pursuing my other passions:

- Anime Fan: Die-hard fan of Japanese animation.

- Sports Enthusiast: A devoted table tennis and volleyball player, I relish the physical and mental challenges of the game. Sports keep me balanced and energized for my work.

- Digital Photography: Capturing moments and experimenting with light and composition is my creative outlet. Photography helps me view the world through a different lens, quite literally.
